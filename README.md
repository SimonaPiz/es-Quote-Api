# es-Quote-Api
> Back-End Development - es by Codecademy

## Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be building a small Express.js web API to store and serve different quotes about computers, coding, and technology.

## Setup Instructions
If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “[Download](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/quote-api/quote-api-starting.zip?_gl=1*nntmfl*_ga*Nzg5Njg1MzM0Ny4xNjY5MDE5Njc0*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY2OTgzNjAwMS4zNS4xLjE2Njk4NDQ0NzMuMC4wLjA.)” button below. You’ll need to open and work in server.js in a text editor. To edit server.js, use your text editor of choice. If you need a recommendation or help to install an editor, we recommend looking into our article about setting up a text editor for web development (Follow along until you get to the section: “Practice: Let’s Make a Project”). To run your API on your computer, you will need to install Node.js. If you need help installing Node.js, read our [article on installing Node](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-node-locally).

Once you have an editor an Node.js set up, download the project, unzip it, navigate to that folder in your terminal and run `npm install` to install Express before trying to start up your server.

## Prerequisites
To complete this project, you should have completed the Express Routes and Express Routers lessons from our Learn Express curriculum.
